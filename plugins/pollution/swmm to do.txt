-	Add a cumulative runoff variable to the subcatchments from the runoff before internal routing, to calculate Kefeng's pollution function
This can be done by adding the variable as Subcatch[j].cumRunoff in the function subcatch_getRunoff
-	for Landuse[i].washoffFunc[p]. add coefficients, exponents and a new functypes (2) (in the input file for each pollutant/lu combo)
-	Add the two different functions for the three pollutatns to landuse_getWashoffQual. I guess we could also include stochastic functions here or unconventinoal sources functions

-	Use NO_BUILDUP and Kefeng's functions? --> add adwp variable to subcachments
-	Use buildup function? --> Change Kefeng's model to fit a buildup + washoff combination rather than adwp.
