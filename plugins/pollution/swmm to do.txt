-	Add a cumulative runoff variable to the subcatchments from the runoff before internal routing, to calculate Kefeng's pollution function
This can be done by adding the variable as Subcatch[j].cumRunoff in the function subcatch_getRunoff
-	for Landuse[i].washoffFunc[p]. add coefficients, exponents and a new functypes (2) (in the input file for each pollutant/lu combo)
-	Add the two different functions for the three pollutatns to landuse_getWashoffQual. I guess we could also include stochastic functions here or unconventinoal sources functions

-	Use NO_BUILDUP and Kefeng's functions? --> add adwp variable to subcachments
-	Use buildup function? --> Change Kefeng's model to fit a buildup + washoff combination rather than adwp. 
-	subcatch_getRunoff uses nonLidarea to calculate the area to calculate runoff from. How will this affect the model (also in the future, if we wanna use LID measures modelling).


the runDepth that I am using now includes the runon. We can remove it later I guess.
cumRunDepth is since the start of the simulation. We should make a function to calculate it from the start of a rain event, and also to calculate ADWP
instead of in SubcatchStats, should we do the cumRunDepth variable in Subcatch?
