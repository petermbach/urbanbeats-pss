## Spatial Data

### Land Use/Land Cover

Land use and land cover are critical for understanding different area effects in the model. Land use plays a dominant role in many UrbanBEATS simulations that uses a simulation grid other than 'parcel-based' representation. The land use in UrbanBEATS follows a custom classification system of 16 categories [1]. To prepare land use data for UrbanBEATS, 

**Table 1.** *UrbanBEATS Land Use Classification System*

| # | Class Name | Abbreviation | Description |
|:--:| :--- | :---: |:----|
|1| Residential | RES | Encompasses all housing tzpes, occurring at a range of different population densities (e.g., detached dwellings, high-rise apartments) |
|2| Commercial | COM | Encompasses all trade activities (e.g., individual shops or larger retail agglomerations) as well as some mixed commercial and industrial activities at different densities |
|3| Mixed Res/Com | ORC | Land which contains either both residential and commercial land or a collection of offices in high-density central business areas or major activity centres, use when land use mix is very dense. |
|4| Light Industry | LI | Industrial practices of low intensity processes such as storage, warehousing, small manufacturing firms. |
|5| Heavy Industry | HI | Industrial practices of high intensity processes, primarily factories, where activities can pose significant environmental concern |
|6| Civic | CIV | A collection of small-footprint facilities for education, community leisure that usually mix with other land uses. |
|7| Service & Utility | SVU | Land allocated to key utility facilities, e.g., local water storage, pumps, gas, electrical and telecommunication facilities. |
|8| Road | RD | Primarily sealed surfaces for carriage of private and commercial vehicles, only consider major arterials and highways, local streets can be depicted, but may create highly variable land use matrices. |
|9| Transport | TR | A collection of key transport facilities for different modes of public transport (e.g., airports, seaports, major railway stations). |
|10| Parks & Garden | PG | Recreational green space for local communities, designed and landscaped for amenity purposes. Parks and Gardens are usually smaller in footprint than other urban green space counterparts. |
|11| Reserves & Floodway | REF | Multi-purpose recreational and more natural expanses of green space. Can be for community use, conveyance of flood waters, natural habitat provision for ecological health. |
|12| Undeveloped | UND | Land that has not been built upon (greenfield) or cleared for redevelopment (brownfield) |
|13| Unclassified | NA | Land for which one of the other categories cannot be assigned, often for a special, unique use for which further planning regulations apply. |
|14| Water | WAT | Major water bodies, covering large expanses of land. Area should be purely water land cover |
|15| Forest | FOR | Forest and woodland area, an all-encompassing category. |
|16| Agriculture | AGR | Agricultural and farmland, typical of modified rural landscapes, but can also occur in urban areas. |
